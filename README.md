## Topic 02- Statements
 This statement sections explained how to organise statements that would take an input and using that input would produce an output. The homework task for this topic is titled 'BMI'. This program asks the user to input their weight in kilograms and their height in centimeters. The program then calculates the persons BMI based on these inputs.

## Topic 03- State
 This section explains the use of variables and how they can be used in the context of python programming. The homework tast for this topic is titled Slicingstring. This program requires the user to input a string of text. The program will then print every second character of the string in a reverse order.

## Topic 04- Flow
 This section explains how a program can make certain decisions based on the inputed criteria. These programs use functions like if, while, else etc.. The homework task for this topic is titled collatz. The collatz program asks the user to input a positve integer. The program will then carry out a different calculation based on whether the inputted number is an odd or even number. If the input is odd then the program will multiply the given number by 3 and add 1. If the input is even it will divide the number by 2. The program will continue to carry out the function on the results of these calculations while the inputted number is greater than 1.[2]

## Topic 05- Complex data
 This section explains how dictionarys can be used in python. These dictionarys can be used to carry out more complex functions in python and are basically programs pre-written by other python programmers. The homework task for this topic is titled weekday. This program determines whether the day that the program is ran on is a weekday or a weekend. It utilises the datetime function and also uses 'if' and 'else' functions. The program will then print a message to tell the user if it is a weekday or not.

## Topic 06- Functions
 This section explains how functions are used and demonstrates how efficient they can be when developing more complex projects. The homework task for this project is titled squareroot. This program calculates the approximate value of the squareroot of a given number using the newton raphson method. This program will request the user to input a number that they would like the squareroot of. This program will then output the approximate square root value using the newton-raphson method [3].

## Topic 07- Reading files
 This section shows how python can be used to interact with files. The homework task for this topic is titled 'readfile'. This program will ask the user to input a .txt file name and will then ask what letter the user wants counted. The program will then calculate the number of repeats of the requested letter. There are two .txt files present in the Topic 07 folder. These are called moby-dick and bolt.

## Topic 08- Matplotlib
 This section introduces the Matplotlib libary. This library included various functions that can be used to carry out mathematical process on a range of data. Data visualisation can also be carried out using Matplotlib for example the generation of scatter plots. The homework tast for this topic is titled Mathplt. This program will graph the function f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0,4]. The program will then save the image file with a appropriate title. The result of this program can be viewed in the Topic08-Matplotlib folder.[4]
